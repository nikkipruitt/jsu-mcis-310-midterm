CS 310 Midterm Exam
===================
This exam is worth 15 points and has 5 "questions", each represented by a unit
test. The first 3 questions have their unit tests fully specified, and you must
implement the ConnectFour class methods to ensure that those tests pass correctly.
The final 2 questions only have meaningful unit test names. You must create the
unit tests to satisfy the names and then implement the ConnectFour class methods
so that those tests pass correctly.

If you are unfamiliar with ConnectFour, visit 
[its Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) or do a basic
Google search for the game. It is essentially a more complex version of Tic Tac Toe.
